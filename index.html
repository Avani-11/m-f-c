            I like the Harry Potter Character because he is a very brave boy , when he was small he lost his parents. And because of his Bravery he is Famous.
            He got the admission into a magic boarding school 'Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry'. There he met three close friend 'Hormoine' 'Ronald'and 'Hagrid'. This a fictional character created by J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series.

        <p> Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people). </p>

        <p> My favourite character from Harry Potter's all movies are Harry Potter, Hermoine Granger, Ronald Weasly and Rubius Hagrid, I like Harry Potter's role because his role is of a brave boy who can do anything, and he have very courage because he had wined by Dark Lord Voldemort, I like Hermoine Granger's role because she knows very much better about magic incantation and she have a special necklace in the first year Professer Minerva Mcgonigal have  given that special and magical neklace to Hermoine Granger if Hermoine misses any class of wichcraft, then she uses that necklace to take the missed out class, I like Ronal Weasly's character because when watching the Harry Potter's movie I noticed one thing that Ronald Weasly know more about chess and how to win also and lucky people only have this talent and I liked Rubius Hagrid's role because he is taller in height and he have very much power but he use his power to help any people I like this nature of Mr. Hagrid. </p>
